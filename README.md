## Bio/Concact page
I made this page and github account for a class project, if you aren't in my class then I would like to kindly request that you leave. I am a student currently taking graphic design 1-2 in high school. If you want to contact me please open an issue in this repository [here](https://github.com/EricXinzeMiao/ericxinzemiao.github.io/issues/new). 

## Things I did in graphic design
### Basic Shapes Animal
I drew some animals using only basic shapes. The fish is falling from the fish bowl into the food bowl if you were wondering.

### Self Portrait
I tried to draw myself in adobe illustrator. I was only allowed to use the pen tool.

### Logos
I attempted to make some logos using a vector editor. It was mostly simple lines and shapes.

### Horror movie poster
I tried to make a fake horror movie poster. I hope I did not break any trademark or copyright laws in doing so. If you are Nintento please don't sue me.

### Photoshop Collage
I made a collage using photoshop to learn how to mask objects. I also had to use some effects.

### Billboard Ad
I created a billboard ad for a fake company I made up. Because the company is about free software, I made it in gimp instead of photoshop.

### Planner Cover
With the help of a partner, this planner cover was made for our school. The rocket ships refer to how it used to be said that westview is secretly a missile silo.

### Typeface
I made a typeface which can be used on a computer. It was very fun.

### Packaging Graphics
I made a package cover for google maps. Getting the background was a bit of a pain.

I made an album cover for a fake band I made up. It is a rock band based on data vizualtion.
